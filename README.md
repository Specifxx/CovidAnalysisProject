# CovidAnalysisProject
A cool personal project on COVID Data | Analysis and Visualisation

Dataset used: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths (DATE of data: 08/06/2022)

Current Cool Findings (Australia focused):
- Currently, ~29% of Australia has caught COVID-19. This stat is surprisingly higher than the ~26% having caught COVID-19 in the US.
- A record ~70% of people on the Faeroe Islands have caught COVID historically
- The death rate of catching COVID is 1.176%
- 222.48% of Australiaâ€™s population has been vaccinated - error most likely because booster shots are not factored into the data set.


Stay tuned for updates!!
